# TCP-Chat-Room
TCP chat project containing a server and clients. First thing is to start the server which is connected to the IP address of the local computer and port 55555 
who enables two hosts to establish a connection and exchange streams of data.

Left side of the screen is the server which is already started and is listening. On the right side the two prompts are the clients who should write their nicknames by which they want to be represented.

After we have done the above step as you can see our two friends have joined the connection and they're ready to exchange messages. On the server we can only see who have joined it and his/her nickname, but not the messages.
